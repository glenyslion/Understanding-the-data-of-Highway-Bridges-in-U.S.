**Objectives:**
- Designing ERD of the Database.
- Creating queries for information retrieval with SQL based on the questions below.
- Improving queries' performance.


1. Basic Questions:
   - According to the current raw data, what is the unique number of each bridge?
   - How many bridges have been built in U.S. by the time of the raw data provision?
   - In which year did U.S. build the largest number of bridges?
   - Which state in U.S. has built the largest number of bridges?
   - Which two states in the United States have the most interstate bridges?
   - In terms of traffic, which bridge is the busiest in America?
   - In terms of length, which bridge is the longest in America?

2. Questions about bridge maintenance cost:
   - What is the overall health of bridges in U.S.?
   - Is every bridge regularly checked for health? how often does the government or the owner of the bridge inspect all bridges on average?
   - What is the annual maintenance and improvement cost of each bridge? Sort the results in descending order.
   - What is the total cost of all investment in bridge maintenance and improvement in U.S.?
   - What type of bridge costs the most to maintain and improve?
   - What factors are related to the maintenance and improvement cost of bridges?
   - Which state invests the most in the maintenance and improvement of bridges?
   - What kind of materials are most used in bridge maintenance and improvement?

3. Extra Questions:
   - What other interesting questions or information you want find out from the database? And design a query to solve it.

4. Query Performance Improvement
   - Choose a query statement with slow query speed from the above questions, or design a new query based on the question you want to ask. Use performance enhancing methodsto improve the query speed. Show the comparison results and explain why the query performance improvement method you adopted is significant
